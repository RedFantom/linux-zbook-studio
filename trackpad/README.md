# Trackpad
Use this script to enable/disable the trackpad with a hotkey. This is useful
while typing because the trackpad does not reliably disable itself when typing
under Ubuntu. Script has been tested to work with Ubuntu 17.10 running GNOME
and Kubuntu 17.10 running KDE Plasma 5.11.4.

Use the following command to bind to a keyboard shortcut of your choosing:
```bash
python3 /absolute_path_to_file/trackpad.py
```
It should also work with Python 2, but as it's not tested, why bother if
Ubuntu comes with Python 3 too these days?
