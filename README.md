# Linux on HP ZBook Studio
![license badge](https://img.shields.io/License-MIT-blue.svg)
This is a small collection of tools to help make the HP ZBook Studio work better
with Linux. Also, some manuals for problems I encountered are available in the 
sub-folders, so if you encounter an issue you won't have to do all the 
searching again.

This repository is just a place where I store these things. Feel free to use 
the for whatever purpose in compliance with the license terms found at the 
bottom of this file. More items may be added in the future, or maybe not at all.

## List
A full list of everything provided:

- Trackpad
  A tiny Python script (could also be done in `bash`, but I'm experienced with
  Python) to enable and disable the Trackpad. This is meant to be bound to a 
  keyboard shortcut, to make up for the loss of double-tap-to-disable.
- Bluetooth
  Two small guides with sources describing problems with Bluetooth. Most 
  information on this topic was out-dated for Ubuntu 17.10, so I tried lots
  of things to make it work.
