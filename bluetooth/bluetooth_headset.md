# Bluetooth Headset
If your bluetooth headset has a low sound quality under Ubuntu, then the 
solution is actually really simple.

1. Go into the settings menu
2. Enter sound settings
3. Click your Bluetooth headset
4. Change the sound mode from `HSP/HFP` to `A2DP`

The change should take effect immediately.
